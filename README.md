# Neutrino masses from failed supernovae

Can we measure the mass of neutrinos with a multi-messenger detection of a failed supernova?

The idea is the following: neutrinos being massive gives them a slight delay, which depends on energy: 

![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\Delta&space;t&space;=&space;\frac{D}{c}&space;\frac{m^2}{E^2})

which looks like this:

So, in principle we can use this effect to measure their mass!

# Neutrino masses from failed supernovae

Can we measure the mass of neutrinos with a multi-messenger detection of a failed supernova?

The idea is the following: neutrinos being massive gives them a slight delay, which depends on energy:

which looks like this:

The idea here is to use GW + neutrino emission from failed supernovae to measure the neutrino mass.

  abstract = {We summarize our current understanding of gravitational wave emission from core-collapse supernovae. We review the established results from multi-dimensional simulations and, wherever possible, provide back-of-the-envelope calculations to highlight the underlying physical principles. The gravitational waves are predominantly emitted by protoneutron star oscillations. In slowly rotating cases, which represent the most common type of the supernovae, the oscillations are excited by multi-dimensional hydrodynamic instabilities, while in rare rapidly rotating cases, the protoneutron star is born with an oblate deformation due to the centrifugal force. The gravitational wave signal may be marginally visible with current detectors for a source within our galaxy, while future third-generation instruments will enable more robust and detailed observations. The rapidly rotating models that develop non-axisymmetric instabilities may be visible up to a megaparsec distance with the third-generation detectors. Finally, we discuss strategies for multi-messenger observations of supernovae.},

  abstract = {Newly formed black holes are expected to emit characteristic radiation in the form of quasi-normal modes, called ringdown waves, with discrete frequencies. LISA should be able to detect the ringdown waves emitted by oscillating supermassive black holes throughout the observable Universe. We develop a multi-mode formalism, applicable to any interferometric detectors, for detecting ringdown signals, for estimating black hole parameters from those signals, and for testing the no-hair theorem of general relativity. Focusing on LISA, we use current models of its sensitivity to compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio for ringdown events, the relative parameter estimation accuracy, and the resolvability of different modes. We also discuss the extent to which uncertainties on physical parameters, such as the black hole spin and the energy emitted in each mode, will affect our ability to do black hole spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {We present general relativistic numerical simulations of collapsing stellar cores. Our initial model consists of a low metallicity rapidly-rotating progenitor which is evolved in axisymmetry with the latest version of our general relativistic code CoCoNuT, which allows for black hole formation and includes the effects of a microphysical equation of state (LS220) and a neutrino leakage scheme to account for radiative losses. The motivation of our study is to analyze in detail the emission of gravitational waves in the collapsar scenario of long gamma-ray bursts. Our simulations show that the phase during which the proto-neutron star (PNS) survives before ultimately collapsing to a black hole is particularly optimal for gravitational wave emission. The high-amplitude waves last for several seconds and show a remarkable quasi-periodicity associated with the violent PNS dynamics, namely during the episodes of convection and the subsequent nonlinear development of the standing-accretion shock instability (SASI). By analyzing the spectrogram of our simulations we are able to identify the frequencies associated with the presence of g-modes and with the SASI motions at the PNS surface. We note that the gravitational waves emitted reach large enough amplitudes to be detected with third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope within a Virgo Cluster volume at rates ≲ 0.1 yr−1.},

  abstract = {Rapidly spinning neutron stars are known to harbour pulsation modes that may become unstable and grow in amplitude by emitting gravitational radiation. Among the various stellar modes, the f-mode is the one typically considered as a promising source of gravitational radiation for ground-based detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO. Improving the existing work in Newtonian stellar models, we present the first calculation of the basic properties of the f-mode instability in rapidly rotating relativistic neutron stars, adopting the Cowling approximation. Using a relativistic polytropic stellar model, we obtain a minimum gravitational growth timescale (for the dominant l=m=4 mode) of the order of 10\^3-10\^4 s near the Kepler spin frequency Omega\_K, which is substantially shorter than the Newtonian value. By accounting for dissipation in neutron star matter, i.e. shear/bulk viscosity and superfluid mutual friction, we calculate the associated f-mode instability window. For our specific stellar model, the instability is active above 0.92 \textbackslash times Omega\_K and for temperatures \textbackslash sim (10\^9 - 2 \textbackslash times 10\^\{10\}) K, characteristic of newborn neutron stars.},

  abstract = {Based on our recent three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations including both exploding and non-exploding models, we study the detailed neutrino signals in representative terrestrial neutrino observatories, Super-Kamiokande (Hyper-Kamiokande), DUNE, JUNO, and IceCube. We find that the physical origin of difference in the neutrino signals between 1D and 3D is mainly proto-neutron-star (PNS) convection. We study the temporal and angular variations of the neutrino signals and discuss the detectability of the time variations driven by the spiral Standing Accretion Shock Instability (spiral SASI) when it emerges for non-exploding models. In addition, we determine that there can be a large angular asymmetry in the event rate (\$\textbackslash gtrsim 50 \textbackslash\%\$), but that the time-integrated signal has a relatively modest asymmetry (\$\textbackslash lesssim 20 \textbackslash\%\$). Both features are associated with the lepton-number emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA) and the spiral SASI. Moreover, our analysis suggests that there is an interesting correlation between the total neutrino energy (TONE) and the cumulative number of neutrino events in each detector, a correlation that can facilitate data analyses of real observations. We demonstrate the retrieval of neutrino energy spectra for all flavors of neutrino by applying a novel spectrum reconstruction technique to the data from multiple detectors. We find that this new method is capable of estimating the TONE within the error of \$\textbackslash sim\$20\textbackslash\% if the distance to the CCSN is \$\textbackslash lesssim 6\$ kpc.},

We consider four different neutron star (NS) equations of state (EoS): LS220, SFHo, BHBΛϕ, and DD2, and study the impact of the EoS on BH formation dynamics and GW emission. We find that the BH formation time is sensitive to the EoS from 460 to {$>$}1300 ms and is delayed in multiple dimensions for ∼100–250 ms due to the finite entropy effects. Depending on the EoS, our simulations show the possibility that shock revival can occur along with the collapse of the proto-neutron star (PNS) to a BH. The gravitational waveforms contain four major features that are similar to previous studies but show extreme values: (1) a low-frequency signal (∼300–500 Hz) from core-bounce and prompt convection, (2) a strong signal from the PNS g-mode oscillation among other features, (3) a high-frequency signal from the PNS inner-core convection, and (4) signals from the standing accretion shock instability and convection. The peak frequency at the onset of BH formation reaches to ∼2.3 kHz. The characteristic amplitude of a 10 kpc object at peak frequency is detectable but close to the noise threshold of the Advanced LIGO and KAGRA, suggesting that the next-generation GW detector will need to improve the sensitivity at the kHz domain to better observe stellar-mass BH formation from core-collapse supernovae or failed supernovae.},

The slowly-rotating model explodes at \$\textbackslash sim 650\$\textasciitilde ms postbounce, and the subsequent fallback accretion onto the proto-neutron star (PNS) results in BH formation. In addition, the standing\textasciitilde accretion\textasciitilde shock\textasciitilde instability induces rotation of the proto-neutron star in the model that started with a non-rotating progenitor. Assuming conservation of specific angular momentum during black hole formation, this corresponds to a black\textasciitilde hole spin parameter of \$a=J/M=0.046\$. However, if no explosion sets in, all the angular momentum will eventually be accreted by the BH, resulting in a non-spinning BH. The successful explosion of the slowly-rotating model drastically slows down the accretion onto the PNS, allowing continued cooling and contraction that results in an extremely high gravitational-wave frequency (\$f\textbackslash sim3000\$\textasciitilde Hz) at black\textasciitilde hole formation, while the non-rotating model generates gravitational wave signals similar to our corresponding 2D simulations.},
